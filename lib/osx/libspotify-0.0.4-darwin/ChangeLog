	to this release the music_delivery() callback would be invoked
	with num_frames set to 0 both to indicate audio discontinuity (as
	a result of a seek from the main thread) and also to indicate
	end-of-track.  To ease application development, end_of_track() is
	now invoked at the end of a track and music_delivery() is only
	invoked with num_frames set to 0 as a result of a seek.
