1.  INTRODUCTION

    This is the libspotify C API package.  With it, you can write applications
    that utilize the Spotify music streaming service.


2.  PACKAGE STRUCTURE

3.  COMPATIBILITY AND REQUIREMENTS

    The library was compiled as a three-way universal binary on Mac OS X 10.6.
    It requires:
    - a PPC G4 processor or better, or an Intel processor
    - Mac OS X 10.4 or later


4.  INSTALLATION
    
4.1 Bundling in applications and plugins

    libspotify.framework is built with an install_name of
    @loader_path/../Frameworks/libspotify.framework/Versions/Current/libspotify,
    and should work as-is when bundled with your application or plugin.
    
    To bundle it using Xcode:
    1. Drag libspotify.framework into your project, checking the target
       box for your target if it's not already checked. You might also
       want to choose to copy items into destination group's folder.
    2. Right-click your target and choose 
         Add ▸ New Build Phase ▸ New Copy Files Build Phase
    3. Change "Destination" to "Frameworks" in the build phase properties
       dialog that just popped up.
    4. You probably want to right-click this build phase in the Groups & Files
       sidebar and choose "Rename" to rename it "Copy Frameworks"
    5. Drag libspotify.framework into this build phase in the Groups & Files
       sidebar, as not to confuse it with any other Copy Files phases.
    6. Build. You can confirm that the above worked by choosing
       "Show package contents" on your app/plugin bundle from Finder,
       and confirming that you have a Contents/Frameworks/libspotify.framework
       folder in there.
    
4.2 Building command line applications
    
    Since libspotify.framework is built with an install_name appropriate
    for bundling with apps, it will be tedious to use with command line
    utilities by default. The recommended procedure in this situation
    is to install libspotify.framework into /Library/Frameworks, and then use
    install_name_tool to rewrite the install_name to that path in your
    executable. The examples show how to do this, but in essence:
        install_name_tool -change \     
            @loader_path/../Frameworks/libspotify.framework/libspotify \    
            /Library/Frameworks/libspotify.framework/libspotify \
            path_to_executable
            
    If you'd like to bundle the framework with your executable some other
    way, switch /Library/Frameworks in the above command to something else,
    possibly relative to @loader_path (which is the path to your executable
    at runtime).
    
4.3 Examples
    There are a number of examples in doc/examples that will act as great
    starting points. Have fun!


5.  APPLICATION KEYS

    The example programs require a file called appkey.c which is not present in
    the package.  You will need to request an application key at the
    developer website at http://developer.spotify.com/ before being able to
    run them.


6.  LOGOTYPES AND TRADEMARK

    The graphics found in the images/ subdirectory are available for use in
    applications using libspotify. The terms and conditions for the use of these
    are available on http://developer.spotify.com/.

    A text file is included in images/, containing the text to be used in
    non-graphical applications.


7.  LICENSE

    You should have received a separate LICENSE file together with this README.
